Tasks:

Remove Integrations from Settings Page:

Navigate to the code responsible for rendering the /settings/integrations page.

Identify and remove the UI elements (cards, list items, sections, etc.) and any associated frontend/backend logic specifically related to the following integrations:

Mailchimp

Zapier

Slack

Twilio

HubSpot

Ensure that removing these does not negatively impact the display or functionality of the remaining integrations on the page.

Fix GoHighLevel (GHL) Integration Functionality:

The existing GoHighLevel integration displayed on the /settings/integrations page is currently non-functional.

Refer to the official GoHighLevel Integrations API documentation: https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations to understand the correct implementation requirements.

Analyze Existing Code: Review the current frontend code (for input fields, display logic) and backend code (API key handling, connection logic, API calls) related to the GHL integration.

Implement Correct Setup:

Based on the GHL documentation, determine the necessary configuration fields required on the frontend (e.g., likely an API Key input, potentially others like Location ID).

Ensure the frontend form correctly captures these required fields.

Update the backend endpoint that receives the GHL configuration data.

Implement secure storage for the GHL API Key and any other necessary credentials on the backend.

Implement backend logic to validate the provided GHL credentials. This typically involves making a test API call to a GHL endpoint (e.g., fetching authorized locations or user info) using the provided API Key. Refer to the GHL docs for suitable validation endpoints.

Update the frontend to clearly display the connection status (e.g., "Connected", "Disconnected", "Error: Invalid API Key") based on the validation result from the backend.

Ensure the overall setup process (entering key, saving, validating) is seamless for the user.

Context:

Target Page: /settings/integrations

Problematic Integration: GoHighLevel (needs fixing)

Integrations to Remove: Mailchimp, Zapier, Slack, Twilio, HubSpot

GoHighLevel Documentation: https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations (Use this as the primary reference for fixing GHL).

Please ensure the code changes are clean, follow existing project conventions, and do not introduce new errors.

Why this prompt works well for Replit AI:

Clear Target: Specifies the exact project URL.

Specific Actions: Uses action verbs like "Remove," "Identify," "Fix," "Implement," "Analyze," "Refer."

Detailed Instructions: Breaks down complex tasks (like fixing GHL) into smaller, logical steps (analyze, check docs, implement frontend, implement backend, validate, update status).

Context Provided: Clearly lists the page, the apps to remove, the app to fix, and crucially, the documentation link for the fix.

Focus on Code: Directs the AI to modify code (UI elements, frontend/backend logic, API handling).

Implicit Goal: The overall goal of having a cleaned-up settings page with a working GHL integration is clear.

Constraints/Best Practices: Mentions clean code and avoiding new errors.
