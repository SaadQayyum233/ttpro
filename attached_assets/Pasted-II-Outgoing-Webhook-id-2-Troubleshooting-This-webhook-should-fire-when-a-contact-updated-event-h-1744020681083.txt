II. Outgoing Webhook (id=2) Troubleshooting

This webhook should fire when a contact_updated event happens inside your SaaS application, sending data to webhook.site.

Trigger Logic:

Problem: Your application code needs to detect when a contact is updated. Where does this happen? (e.g., after a database save operation).

Action: Implement the code logic that identifies the contact_updated event.

Sending Logic:

Problem: After detecting the event, your code needs to actually make the HTTP POST request.

Action:

Use an HTTP client library suitable for your language (e.g., requests in Python, axios or node-fetch in Node.js).

Inside the event handler (where contact_updated is detected):

Retrieve the relevant contact data (contact_email, contact_name, contact_id).

Fetch the webhook configuration (URL, method, payload template, headers) for active webhooks triggered by contact_updated.

Format the payload_template by replacing placeholders ({event.type}, {contact.id}, etc.) with actual data.

Parse the headers field. [object Object] is not valid JSON/header format in the CSV. It should likely represent JSON headers like {"Content-Type": "application/json"}. Your code needs to construct a proper header dictionary/object. If no specific headers are needed beyond Content-Type, ensure your HTTP client sends Content-Type: application/json if your payload is JSON.

Make the HTTP POST request to the target_url (https://webhook.site/3cb601c8-2910-40d1-91fd-8d2c3269ef32) with the formatted payload and headers.

Error Handling & Logging:

Problem: If the request fails (network error, webhook.site error), you won't know why.

Action: Add logging within your sending logic. Log the constructed payload, headers, target URL, and any success or error responses from the HTTP request. Check the Replit console for these logs.

Testing Connectivity:

Action: Open the "Shell" tab in your Replit workspace and test basic connectivity:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test": "hello"}' https://webhook.site/3cb601c8-2910-40d1-91fd-8d2c3269ef32
Use code with caution.
Bash
Check webhook.site to see if this manual request arrives. If it does, the network path from Replit is open. The issue is likely in your application's trigger or sending logic.

III. Incoming Webhook (id=1) Troubleshooting

This webhook expects an external service to send data to your SaaS application running on Replit.

Endpoint Definition:

Problem: The CSV defines an endpoint_token but doesn't specify the URL path on your application where requests should be sent. An incoming webhook needs a specific URL to hit. The target_url is empty, which is correct for incoming, but your app needs to provide the URL.

Action:

Define a route in your web server framework. This URL should be unique and identifiable, often incorporating the endpoint_token to distinguish it. Example URL structure: https://your-repl-name.your-username.replit.dev/webhooks/incoming/custom/{endpoint_token} (replace {endpoint_token} with the actual token 49c14...).

So, the full URL to give to the sending service would be: https://your-repl-name.your-username.replit.dev/webhooks/incoming/custom/49c1493ea43d947bf516d4ea50f2eaef95f5e12be79d36206b60cc1607995975

Implement the handler function for this route in your application code.

Request Handling Logic:

Problem: When a request hits your defined endpoint, your application needs code to do something with it (the "Get Contact" action).

Action: In the route handler function:

Receive the incoming request (check method, headers, body).

Parse the request body (likely JSON).

Perform the action described by the webhook ("Get Contact" - what does this mean? Fetch contact data based on the payload? Log the incoming data?). Implement this logic.

Send an appropriate HTTP response (e.g., 200 OK, 202 Accepted, or an error code).

Authentication/Verification (Optional but Recommended):

Problem: Anyone knowing the URL could potentially send data. The endpoint_token is public in the URL here. A secret_key (which is empty in your CSV) is often used for signature verification (e.g., HMAC-SHA256) to ensure the request came from the expected provider and wasn't tampered with.

Action (Future): Consider adding a secret_key to your webhook configurations and implement signature verification in your endpoint handler if security is needed.

Testing:

Action:

Ensure your Replit app is running and the web server is active.

Use webhook.site (or curl, Postman) to send a request to your Replit webhook URL (the one you defined in step III.1).

Example using curl from your local machine or another service:

curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"some_key": "some_value", "contact_id_to_get": "123"}' \
  https://your-repl-name.your-username.replit.dev/webhooks/incoming/custom/49c1493ea43d947bf516d4ea50f2eaef95f5e12be79d36206b60cc1607995975
Use code with caution.
Bash
Check your application's logs in the Replit console to see if the request was received and processed, and look for any errors.

IV. Configuration (webhooks.csv) Issues

headers: [object Object]: This needs to be corrected in your CSV or handled by your application code. It should ideally be valid JSON string like "{\"Content-Type\":\"application/json\"}" or your code needs to know to default to standard headers if it sees this placeholder.

Incoming Webhook Path: Your system needs a way to map the endpoint_token to a specific URL path within your application. This logic isn't defined by the CSV alone.

Summary of Actions for Replit:

Ensure App Runs: Verify your web application starts correctly in Replit and listens on 0.0.0.0:<port>.

Implement Outgoing Logic: Write code that detects contact_updated, formats the payload, sets correct headers (e.g., Content-Type: application/json), and sends the POST request using an HTTP client library. Add extensive logging.

Implement Incoming Logic: Define a route (URL path) in your web app incorporating the endpoint_token. Write handler code for that route to receive requests, parse them, perform the "Get Contact" action, and send a response. Add logging.

Test Incoming URL: Construct the full public URL for your incoming webhook endpoint and test sending requests to it from webhook.site or curl.

Consider "Always On": If incoming webhooks need to be reliable, enable "Always On" or use an external ping service.

Check Logs: Constantly monitor your application's logs in the Replit console for errors during both sending and receiving webhook attempts.

Correct Headers: Fix the [object Object] placeholder in your configuration or code.
